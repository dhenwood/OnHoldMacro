# OnHoldMacro
Update Cisco Navigator Outside panel to Blue (On-Hold) when initiated by a user in Cisco Spaces. If no one books the room after 3 minutes, the room will return to default LED and wallpaper. Alternatively, if a user presses "Book Room" from outside panel, it will go back to default LED/Color states.
